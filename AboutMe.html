<title>About Me</title>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a keen interest in design, I began my first Temp job after school in July 2013 at the House of Superior Clothing(HSC). This was an exciting opportunity to surround myself with beautifully made, exclusive garments and help customers find the perfect garment for any occasion. This is undoubtably where I gained the most knowledge on sales and customer experience through first hand interactions with various clients.

</br>
</br>
While working at HSC I met an inspiring coworker who was studying a Bachelors in Consumer Sciences and as I was taking Consumer Sciences and Design in High School this seemed like a natural degree to pursue. The degree was a perfect blend of Business, Marketing and Design which aligned with my interests and experience. In this time I was also able to secure several part time employment opportunities in Marketing and as a Brand Ambassador.

With many friends in the IT field, I was reminded of the many bariers to my curiosity with computers growing up and realised that I could now work and fund a degree through UNISA to explore the fascinating world of computing. While it was certaily not an easy situation to be in while studying any degree, I am glad to have completed it.

Currently, I am based in Cape Town working remoterly as a Quadient Consultant for Beehive Online Solutions.
